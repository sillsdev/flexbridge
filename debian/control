Description: Allow multiple FieldWorks users to collaborate remotely
 FLEx Bridge is an application that allows multiple FieldWorks 8.0 users
 to do remote collaboration (i.e., not necessarily connected by a local
 network).  Data can be shared via a local network (which is not really
 "remote"), the Internet, or a USB memory device.
