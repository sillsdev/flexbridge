    Download geckofx using nuget, so we can compile using geckofx60
    from nuget, rather than using it from FieldWorks since we don't
    necessarily know where that will be on a developer's machine. This
    will also be used at run-time on a developer's machine.

    But we don't ship geckofx60, since geckofx60 from FieldWorks will be
    used at run-time, when flexbridge is installed from a package. -->
