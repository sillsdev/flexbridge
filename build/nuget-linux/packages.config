    Download geckofx using nuget, so we can compile using geckofx45
    from nuget, rather than using it from FieldWorks since we don't
    necessarily know where that will be on a developer's machine. This
    will also be used at run-time on a developer's machine.

    But we don't ship geckofx45, since flexbridge is an architecture-
    independent package. Instead, geckofx45 from FieldWorks will be
    used at run-time, when flexbridge is installed from a package.

    Download 32-bit so a developer can run flexbridge on a 32-bit
    machine using 32-bit geckofx. -->
