		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<p><a href="http://projects.palaso.org/projects/liftbridge">Lift Bridge</a> is a plugin for <a href="http://www.sil.org/computing/fieldworks/flex/">FieldWorks Language Explorer</a> which permits sharing of <a href="http://projects.palaso.org/projects/lift">LIFT</a> dictionary data with remote colleagues such as <a href="http://wesay.org/wiki/Main_Page">WeSay</a>.</p>
		<h1>Usage</h1>
		<p>See <a href="http://projects.palaso.org/projects/liftbridge/wiki">documentation</a> for details on how to use Lift Bridge.</p>
		<h1>Downloads</h1>
		<p>Lift Bridge is now available for use with only one version of FieldWorks, which is the 7 series (7.1 or higher). The older version that worked with FieldWorks 6.0.6 is no longer available, since the older version of FieldWorks is not getting required bug fixes in it that are needed to run Lift Bridge properly.</p>

		<h1>Release Notes:</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>DEV_VERSION_NUMBER <ol> <li>Set Lift Bridge to not allow FLEx to do Send/Receive again, if the last attempt ended with failing to import what had come in.
